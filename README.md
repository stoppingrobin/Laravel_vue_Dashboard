# Laravel Project Template with Jetstream, Inertia.js, and Vue.js  

This repository serves as a **starter template** for building web applications using Laravel, Jetstream, Inertia.js, and Vue.js. With this setup, developers can quickly scaffold a modern full-stack application that combines the power of Laravel for backend development with the flexibility of Vue.js for the frontend.  

## Features  

### Laravel Framework  
- Built on Laravel, a robust and scalable PHP framework that provides a seamless developer experience.  
- Includes powerful features such as routing, Eloquent ORM, Blade templating (optional), and middleware.  

### Jetstream  
- Pre-integrated with Laravel Jetstream for authentication scaffolding, including user registration, login, email verification, and password reset functionality.  
- Supports **Teams** and **Profile Management** (optional).  

### Inertia.js  
- Uses Inertia.js to create a "single-page application" feel without the complexity of a fully client-side app.  
- Bridges the gap between Laravel backend and Vue.js frontend, allowing you to write full-stack apps effortlessly.  

### Vue.js  
- Leverages Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework, for building dynamic, reactive user interfaces.  
- Preconfigured with Vue Router and state management tools like Pinia or Vuex (can be added).  

## Quick Start

   ```bash  
   php artisan key:generate  
   ```  

6. Run database migrations:  
   ```bash  
   php artisan migrate  
   ```  

7. Start the development server:

   php artisan serve  
   npm run dev  
   ```  

You can now access your application at `http://localhost:8000`.
